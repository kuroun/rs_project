== README

- Use RoR framework (MVC), Strategy Pattern, having a main Recommender class functioning as an interface to output recommending items by creating object of recommender strategy classes (delegate, delegate, delegate) (files located in lib/item_recommendation_strategies directory)
- Using pure SQL query to retrieve items. 
- In order to improve performance of retrieval:
  1. I add index to columns: items_users.user_id, categories_items.category_id, items_users.item_id, items.name
  2.  Implement Rails page caching in RecommendationsController 
- Testing coverage (using Rspec): I create nine test cases that cover on Models, Controllers, Routes, and Views
